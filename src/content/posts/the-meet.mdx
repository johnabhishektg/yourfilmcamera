_I happened to talk to the dead._

_he said it’s a lousy sleep of seven Neptune years._

_The curious organ in my skull questioned the dead a lot._

_His answers were brief and wholesome._

_Here’s a few I don’t mind showing you_

_The literal words he pulled out as an explanation to his experience when I asked him were these_

_:”who are you when you’re dead?”_

_:”oh dear, I’m not sure of who I am. You could be talking to your great dead cousin or John Lennon and neither of us would know it”_

-

_:” how do you think your close ones should handle your loss?”_

_:”we the dead, don’t have expectations. They should accept the fact that I won’t be returning, atleast as myself. it’s very hard to digest a huge change in life. It’s takes time. but that’s what living is. I like to refer to it is as adaptation.”_

-

_:”do you think you’ll wake up someday (from the dead)?”_

_:” I am not very sure if I’m taking a break from life or if this is my afterlife. This silence is not troubling. But I don’t mind waking up either. Life can’t be monotonous. And I’m assuming it applies for death too”_

-

_:” would you like to describe what not feeling anything might feel like ?”_

_:” I think I have no complaints. Not for being dead, not about aches, not those bills I paid. It’s a void. But it’s also everything I want. It’s literally nothing and also entirely something. I have no words. I have no tunes. I’m asleep and I don’t even have a dream. It’s not an end. It’s a beginning. It’s not noisy. It’s like you’re asking me to elaborate my deep sleep. I took it as it came to me. I advice you the same._

_a lot of people consider it a measurement of pain. I don’t see why, really. It’s more of a soothing concept. And it definitely has to be put under the list of guilty pleasures. I admit I am pleased by this feeling that I don’t feel anymore.”_

-

_He also said he’ll see me around._

Hello Readers, such a pleasure writing  to you, again.

Last night, My imagination shot me to a strike up a conversation with the dead. We all think of it as an intimidating part of life. But a dearest person to me woke me up to think of it in a disparate manner.

> “As materialism rots this world, I shall gently take my ticket back home, for my right form”

Today’s email is dedicated to this beautiful soul. &#xA;

Feeling more than alive,
Wishes the same for you,
