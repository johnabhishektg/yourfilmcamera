Summers were easy

impulsive shifts catching on

taking rides back home

the word home being very definite to where ever we were

watching vague movies that described everything we needed and then some more

the three-sixty degree of completeness

in the quiet, empty room

and a mattress pulled on the floor

to make it more quiet but fuller

satisfied,

joint,

and complete

walking the streets and towards a search

eating what’s called cheaper the tastier

listening to an ode by Blake himself

smoking in corners between walls

-

living like suffering

gave birth to The art.

proceeding to stamp the religion as imagination

i say this way the culture remains

culture of his music, my words, our movies and all that

to bring two of lunacy’s children an identity

from lost to lucid

building on teeny complexes

cemented by love

creating a thing from the many we see.
