cheeks are numb

can you see the grass taller than you?

my beanie won't stop changing colours

my street sells mirrors that deforms my shape

its not the pink elephants,

i feel my brain travel through my knees

i drag my toes to grab those sunglasses

maybe i wont seem that crazy

these words like cobainâ€™s

will never make sense to you

where is the music ?

or is this the end ?

whats the stamp under my tongue ?

is this your spell, friend?

-

the plain, unvarying ceiling has constellations

hold on while i discover the pattern for our love

i draw a rainbow with stars

i sign our names

but who are you ?

-

my bed is a crocodile

so wild, so hungry to swallow me in

the sheets shall protect me

-

my nerves, wavey

my eyes, multiplying

-

tell me what on mars is happening ?
