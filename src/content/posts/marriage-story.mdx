I wouldnt know how to define love if i hadnt on a random day decided to watch Marriage story. I could say love isnt one element. The need of space is a growing part of being in love. Im not saying the love reduces that way. Nicole and Charlie are tied through roots. love is mostly what is narrated from Nicole and charlie's pieces of writings about each other. The ugliness of separating is denial, anger and pain. But how does Noah Baumbach manage to show the entirety of that ugliness so artistically?

Nicole and Charlie, still married, are on the edge of a divorce. They met when he was directing a play. They have a beautiful little boy, Henry whom they dont want put through any suffering because of them. Noah gracefully takes us through Nicole leaving the house to shoot a pilot in LA and takes Henry along with her. when charlie visits Nicole's mother's, where they reside and she hands him a notice for a legal divorce from her lawyer Nora. Ah talk about the genius that Nora is. She is the perfect combination of empathy and convincing. After an expensive, verbal court day they realize the unnecessity of everything they have been through. They know they cant not love each other after Charlie reads Nicole's piece.
Humorous, this domestic drama will leave you in tears. Starring Scarlet Johansson, Adam Driver and Laure Dern and their unbelievable performance will educate you with the elements of love and definitely on how expensive divorces are xP
